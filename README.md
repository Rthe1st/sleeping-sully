A game made as a secret santa present, deployed using github pages at [sleepingsully.com](https://sleepingsully.com)

I used [this](https://github.com/geocine/phaser3-rollup-typescript) for the basic project setup, and most other code is heavily based on different [phaser 3 examples](https://phaser.io/examples).

To build and run it, you should only need [Node and NPM installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Once you have them installed, run these from a command line/terminal prompt:

```bash
npm install --dev
npm run dev
```

Then go to [localhost:3000]() in a web browser.
